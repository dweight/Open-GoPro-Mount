# Open GoPro Mount

A modular open source GoPro mount for FPV Drones.

## STL Files
[STL files](./STL) are ready to print GoPro Mounts, all available combinations of camera holders and frames mounts are available in the [STL folder](./STL)
If your specific camera model or frame is not yet supported, please [file a request](https://github.com/theely/Open-GoPro-Mount/issues).


## Design Principle
* Designed to be extremely duravble, ultra light and easy to 3D print.
* Modular approach to allow reusability of the component and easy portability to different quad frame designs.

## How to contribute?

The Open-GoPro-Mount is made of 4 components:
* GoPro Holder
* Quad Frame Mount
* Lens protection
* GoPro Screen protection

### Prorting the Open-GoPro-Mount to a new Quad Frame
To port the Open-GoPro-Mount to a new quad frame it's sufficent to design a new Quad Frame Mount.
Either by adapting an existing mount (e.g. Apex Mount (22.5°).step) or by design a new one from scratch.

#### Requirements
Each frame mount should include the following joint pice (red part) in order to be compatible with the GoPro Holder.

The joint (red part) has the following dimensions:

Its important to respect the distance between the two red pieces:

### Adapting the Open-GoPro-Mount for a new Camera

The modular design of the Open-GoPro-Mount should allow easy portability and adaptations.
* To port the GoPro mount to a new frame it should be sufficent to modify or design a new Mount (ref. Apex Mount (22.5°).step)
* To support additional cameras modify an existing Mount (ref. GoPro Hero 5/6/7 Mount.step) or design a new one.

* Universal Screen Protection.step
##### Cameras
* GoPro Hero 5/6/7 Mount.step
##### Frames
* Apex Support (22.5°).step
