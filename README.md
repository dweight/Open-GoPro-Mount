# Open GoPro Mount

A modular open source GoPro mount for FPV Drones.

## [STL Files](./STL)
STL files are ready to print GoPro Mounts, all available combinations of camera holders and frames mounts are available in the [STL folder](./STL)
If your specific camera model or frame is not yet supported, please [file a request](https://github.com/theely/Open-GoPro-Mount/issues).


## Design Principle
* Designed to be extremely duravble, ultra light and easy to 3D print.
* Modular approach to allow reusability of the component and easy portability to different quad frame designs.

## How to 3D Print
* The main body is designed to be printed with TPU A95 or A98.
* The screen protector is best printed with rigid materials such as PLA, PETG or PC.

### How to contribute?
The modular design of the Open-GoPro-Mount should allow easy portability and adaptations.
* To port the GoPro mount to a new frame it should be sufficent to modify or design a new Support (ref. Apex Support (22.5°).step) to be combined with an existing mount.
* To support additional cameras modify an existing Mount (ref. GoPro Hero 5/6/7 Mount.step) or design a new one.
